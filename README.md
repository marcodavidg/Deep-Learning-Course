# HW1

I developed a custom neural network to address both regression and classification tasks. The accompanying report details the feature selection process and provides a comprehensive analysis of the results. The complete reports are available in their respective folders.

## Results

Below are the results obtained for the regression problem.

The data used for this analysis was not sourced from any publicly available dataset. Instead, it was provided in specific files.

# HW2

This assignment focused on convolutional neural networks and was divided into two main sections:

- Utilized the MNIST Dataset for training and evaluation.
- Selected appropriate stride and filter sizes for convolutional layers.
- Printed feature maps to visualize network activations.
- Applied L2 regularization to the model to mitigate overfitting.

- Utilized the CIFAR-10 Dataset for training and evaluation.
- Selected appropriate stride and filter sizes for convolutional layers.
- Performed pre-processing of images prior to model training.

# HW3

This homework assignment centers on a text generation task employing a recurrent neural network. Two models were implemented: one with simple recurrent units and another utilizing LSTM units. The results of these experiments are detailed in the following sections. The implementation was carried out using TensorFlow, with TensorBoard used for visualizing the training process. The primary code resources were sourced from TensorFlow's official documentation available on their website.

- Implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM units.
- Developed an RNN without LSTM units for comparison.
- Conducted a thorough comparison of the performance of both models.
